# Object Detection app with React Native

## Coco SSD
Implemented the Coco SSD object detection model from Tensorflow @tensorflow-models/coco-ssd

## TensorCamera 
Used the TensorCamera component from @tensorflow/tfjs-react-native to yield tensors from a live camera stream. 
It wraps around the Camera component from expo-camera.

## Demo Preview

Demo preview of the app will be posted on my YouTube channel soon: https://www.youtube.com/@Chevrode

## Update: 

Since the last time I ran the app and made the demo video in April 2024, I think there was some package updates, and unfortunately the new versions of react native and tensorflow.js I used in this project are no longer compatible, and the old versions are deprecated.
